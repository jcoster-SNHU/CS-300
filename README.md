# CS-300

This repository includes my two projects for CS-300 that show my analysis of run time and memory for data structures and my working CPP program that sort and list courses in alphanumeric order. 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?:

During this course I was tasked with understanding different data models like binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists. I used these different data structures to build different sorting algorithms to find the most efficient and effective way to sort the lists.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.:

I had some experience with sorting methods before this course, so I knew I had to find the best balance between sorting efficiency and collision rate, and how easy they were to implement. Understanding how these data
structures were constructed, and how they were implemented in code helped drive my decisions on which to use. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?:

I struggle the most with effective testing when implementing these types of methods throughout the activities, I should have spent more time testing individual blocks or smaller use cases before moving onto the final
product in my CPP files. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I think having a better understanding on sorting methods and algorithms in general helps any developer think about how they handle data in their projects. Being able to effectively manipulate data structures 
will make your future coding projects function more efficiently.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project gave me great practice with implementing these different data streams and making good base code for future projects where I might use similar methods.
